Data on the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) residues in
a series of lake trout from Cayuga Lake, NY, were reported in
\citeasnoun{bach:seru:youn:lisk:1972}
and are reproduced in Table~\ref{atbl:pcb}.

The ages of the fish were accurately known, because the fish are
annually stocked as yearlings and distinctly marked as to year class.
Each whole fish was mechanically chopped, ground, and thoroughly mixed,
and 5-gram samples taken.
The samples were treated and PCB residues in parts per million (ppm)
were estimated using column chromatography.

A linear model
$$
f ( x, \bbeta )=\beta_1+\beta_2 x
$$
is proposed where $f$ is predicted ln(PCB
concentration) and $x$ is $\cubage$.

\section{Rumford}

Data on the amount of heat generated by friction were obtained by
Count Rumford in 1798.
A bore was fitted into a stationary cylinder and pressed against the
bottom by means of a screw.
The bore was turned by a team of horses for 30 minutes, after which
Rumford ``suffered the thermometer to remain in its place
nearly three quarters of an hour, observing and noting down, at small
intervals of time, the temperature indicated by it'' \cite{roll:1950}.
(See Table~\ref{atbl:rum})

A model based on Newton's law of cooling was proposed as

\section{Puromycin}

Data on the ``velocity''
of an enzymatic reaction were obtained by \citeasnoun{trel:1974}.
%\glossary{ Treloar, M.A.}
The number of counts per minute of radioactive product from the reaction
was measured
as a function of substrate concentration in parts per million (ppm) and
from these counts the initial rate, or ``velocity,''
of the reaction was
calculated (counts/min$^{2}$).
The experiment was conducted once with the enzyme treated with
Puromycin, [(a) in Table~\ref{atbl:mic}] and once with the enzyme
untreated (b).

The velocity is assumed to depend on the substrate concentration
according to the Michaelis--Menten equation.
It was hypothesized that the ultimate velocity parameter
($\theta_1$) should be affected by introduction of the Puromycin,
but not the half-velocity parameter ($\theta_2$).

The Michaelis--Menten model is
$$
f(x, \btheta ) ={\theta_1 x \over \theta_{2+x}}
$$
where $f$ is predicted velocity and $x$ is substrate concentration.

\section{BOD}

Data on biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were obtained by \citeasnoun{mars:1967}.
%\glossary{ Marske, D.}
To determine the BOD, a sample of stream water was taken, injected
with soluble organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and dissolved
oxygen, and subdivided into BOD bottles.  Each bottle was innoculated
with a mixed culture of microorganisms, sealed, and incubated at
constant temperature, and then the bottles were opened periodically
and analyzed for dissolved oxygen concentration, from which the BOD
was calculated in milligrams per liter (mg/l).  (See Table~\ref{atbl:bod})  The
values shown are the averages of two analyses on each bottle.

A model was derived based on exponential decay with a fixed rate
constant as
$$
f(x, \btheta ) =\theta_1
( 1 - e^{ \theta_2 x } )
$$
where $f$ is predicted biochemical oxygen demand and $x$ is time.
\section{Isomerization}

Data on the reaction rate of the catalytic isomerization of
$n$-pentane to isopentane versus the partial pressures of hydrogen,
$n$-pentane, and isopentane were given in \citeasnoun{carr:1960} and
are reproduced in Table~\ref{atbl:iso}.

Isomerization is a chemical process in which a complex chemical is
converted into more simple units, called isomers: catalytic
isomerization employs catalysts to speed the reaction.
The reaction rate depends on various factors, such as partial
pressures of the products and the concentration of the catalyst.
The differential reaction rate was expressed as grams of isopentane
produced per gram of catalyst per hour (hr$^{-1}$), and the
instantaneous partial pressure of a component was calculated as
the mole fraction of the component times the total pressure, in pounds
per square inch absolute (psia).

A common form of model for the reaction rate is the Hougen--Watson model
\cite{houg:wats:1947},
%\glossary{ Hougen, O.A.}
%\glossary{ Watson, K.M.}
of which the following is a special case,
$$
f ( \bx , \btheta )  =
{\theta_1 \theta_3 ( x_2 - x_3 / 1.632 )  \over 1 + \theta_2 x_1 +
\theta_3 x_2 + \theta_4 x_3}
$$
where $f$ is predicted reaction rate, $x_{1}$ is partial pressure of
hydrogen, $x_{2}$ is partial pressure of isopentane, and $x_{3}$ is
partial pressure of $n$-pentane.

\section{$\alpha$-Pinene}

$\alpha$-pinene, a component of turpentine,
were reported in \citeasnoun{fugu:hawk:1947}.

In this experiment, the relative concentrations (\%) of

A model was derived from the theory of ion transport as

\section{Ethyl Acrylate}

Data on the metabolism of ethyl acrylate
were obtained by giving rats a bolus of
radioactively tagged ethyl acrylate \cite{watt:debe:stir:1986}.
%\glossary{ Stiratelli, R.G.}
%\glossary{ deBethizy, D.}
%\glossary{ Watts, D.G.}
Each rat was given a measured dose of the compound via stomach
intubation and placed in an enclosed cage from which the air
could be drawn through a bubble chamber.
The exhalate was bubbled through the chamber, and at a
specified time the bubble chamber was replaced by a fresh one, so
that the measured response was the accumulated CO$_{2}$ during
the collection interval.
The response reported in Table~\ref{atbl:co2} is the average, for nine rats,
\begin{table}

of the amount of accumulated
CO$_{2}$ normalized by actual dose,
in units of grams CO$_{2}$ per gram acrylate per gram rat.
An empirical model with three exponential terms was
determined from inspection of plots of the data and physical reasoning.
Logarithms of the integrated function were fitted to logarithms of the
data, using the refinements of Section 3.9.

The integrated model is written
\begin{eqnarray*}
  F(\bx,\btheta)&=&-{\theta_4+\theta_5\over\theta_1}e^{-\theta_1 x_1}
  (1-e^{-\theta_1 x_2})\\
  &&+{\theta_4\over\theta_2}e^{-\theta_2 x_1}(1-e^{-\theta_2 x_2})
  +{\theta_5\over\theta_3}e^{-\theta_3 x_1}(1-e^{-\theta_3 x_2})
\end{eqnarray*}
where $F$ is predicted CO$_{2}$ exhaled during an interval,
$x_{1}$ is interval starting time, and $x_{2}$ is interval
duration.

\section{Saccharin}

Data on the metabolism of saccharin compounds were obtained by \citeasnoun{renw:1982}.
%\glossary{ Renwick, A.G.}
In this experiment, a rat received a single bolus of saccharin, and the
amount of saccharin excreted was measured by collecting urine in
contiguous time intervals.
The measured response was the level of radioactivity of the urine, which
was converted to amount of saccharin in micrograms ($\mu$g).
(See Table~\ref{atbl:sac}.)

\section{Nitrite Utilization}

Data on the utilization of nitrite in bush beans as a function of
light intensity were obtained by J.R. Elliott and D.R. Peirson of
Wilfrid Laurier University.
%\glossary{ Elliott, J.R.}
%\glossary{ Peirson, D.R.}
Portions of primary leaves from three 16-day-old bean plants were
subjected to eight levels of light intensity measured in microeinsteins
per square metre per second ($\mu {\rm E/m}^{2}$s) and the nitrite
utilization in nanomoles of NO$_2^{-}$ per gram per hour
(nmol/ghr) was measured.  The experiment was repeated on a different
day.  (See Table~\ref{atbl:nitrite})

An empirical model was suggested to satisfy the requirements of
zero nitrite utilization at zero light intensity and approach to an
asymptote as light intensity increased.
Two models were fitted which rose to a peak and then began to decline,
as described in Section 3.12.
These models are
$$
f(x, \btheta ) = { \theta_1 x   \over  \theta_2 + x + \theta_3  x^2 }
$$
and
$$
f(x, \btheta ) = \theta_1 ( e^{ - \theta_3 x } -
e^{ - \theta_2 x })
$$
where $f$ is predicted nitrite utilization and $x$ is light intensity.

\section{s-PMMA}

Data on the dielectric behavior of syndiotactic
poly(methylmethacrylate) (s-PMMA) were obtained
by \citeasnoun{havr:nega:1967}.
%\glossary{ Havriliak, S.Jr.}
%\glossary{ Negami, S.}
A disk of the polymer was inserted between the two
metal electrodes of a dielectric cell which formed one arm of a
four-armed electrical bridge.
The bridge was powered by an oscillating voltage whose frequency
$f$ could be changed from 5 to
500000 hertz (Hz), and bridge balance was achieved using capacitance
and conductance standards.
The complex dielectric constant was calculated using changes
from the standards relative to the cell dielectric constant.
Measurements were made by simultaneously adjusting the capacitance
(real) and the conductance (imaginary) arms of the bridge
when it was excited at a specific frequency.
The measured responses were the relative capacitance and relative
conductance (dimensionless).
(See Table~\ref{atbl:spmma})

Oil shale contains organic matter which is organically bonded to
the structure of the rock:
to extract oil from the rock, heat is applied, and so the technique
is called pyrolysis.
During pyrolysis, the benzene organic material, called kerogen,
decomposes chemically to oil and bitumen, and there are
unmeasured by-products of insoluble organic residues and light
gases.
The responses measured were the concentrations of oil and
bitumen (\%).
The initial concentration of kerogen was 100\%.

An empirical compartment model with two exponential terms was proposed,
based on inspection of plots of the data.
The system diagram of the final 3-compartment catenary
model fitted in Section 5.4 is given in
Figure~\ref{fig:tetra}.

(A mammary model was also fitted, as discussed in Section 5.4.)
It is assumed that the initial concentration in compartment 1 is 100\%
and that the only response measured is the concentration in compartment 1.
